# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis 
As a data analyst for PyBer, a Python based ride-sharing app company, my first assigment was to perform an exploratory analysis on data in some very large csv files. To create several types of visualization to tell a compelling story about data. To write Python scripts using Panda's libraries, the jupyter notebook, and matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city, the number of drivers and riders. 

Later, V. Isualize, a co-founder of PyBer has given a brand-new assignment. To create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordibility for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Results

_Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types:_

- Rural cities have the lowest total rides, total drivers, total fares, and highest values in average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
- Urban cities have the highest total rides, total drivers, total fares, and have the lowest values in average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
- Suburban cities lies in between of the Rural and Urban cities in terms of total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver.
- The total fares in urban cities is twice as higher than suburban cities and nine times higher than in rural cities.
- There are thirteen times more rides in urban cities compare to rural cities.
- The average fare per ride is 1.4 times less in urban cities as compared to rural cities.
- The average fare per driver is 3.4 times less in urban cities as compared to rural cities.

_Total Fare by City Type Chart_

The above chart displays the weekly data of the fares for each city type from January to April. It can be concluded from the plot that PyBer has more total fares in urban cities rather than in suburban and rural cities, hence will generate more revenue as compare to the other two city types.
